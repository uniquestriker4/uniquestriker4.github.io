    EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is the fixed amount you pay every month
    to repay a loan. This EMI calculator helps you calculate your monthly EMI
    based on loan amount, interest rate, and tenure. It is useful for home loans,
    car loans, and personal loans.

  <h2>EMI Formula</h2>
  <p>
    EMI is calculated using the following formula:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>EMI = [P × R × (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N − 1]</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Example EMI Calculation</h2>
  <p>
    For a loan of ₹5,00,000 at an interest rate of 10% for 60 months,
    the EMI will be approximately ₹10,624.
  </p>

  <h2>Why EMI Calculation Is Important</h2>
  <p>
    Calculating EMI helps you understand your monthly financial commitment
    before taking a loan. It allows better budgeting and prevents financial stress.
